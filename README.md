# Cryptography
* Defination
  * Cryptography is about securing communication in the presence of malicious adversaries.
* Fundamental Goal
  * ConÙè∞Ådentiality: Keep data secret from all but those authorized to see it
  * Data integrity: Ensure data has not been altered by unauthorized means
  * Data origin authentication: Corroborate the sauce of data
  * Non-repudiation: Prevent an entity from denying previous commitments or actions


##### [Symmeic-Key Encryption](https://github.com/DevinQi/Cryptography/tree/master/SKES)
 * The simple substitution cipher
 * Polylphabetic cipher
 * The one-time pad
